Today I started with the tutorials on GitHub: https://skills.github.com/

I learned something about
* creating branches, pull requests and merging back into main
* [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), the formatting language for GitHub
* creating pages and blogs on GitHub. If you van read this page, I reached the goal of the tutorial 😁
* creating a task list
* adding images ![image of tacocat](https://www.creativefabrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11/cute-taco-cat-vector-cartoon-style-Graphics-9469186-1-1-580x387.jpg)
